1. Navigating through Emacs source code
(* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))

(+ 1 (logb (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))))

C-h k is the keystroke for the describe-key command. Running C-h k will prompt the user to enter a keystroke to describe,
and inputting C-h k again will describe the describe-key command itself. This is equivalent to reading the description for C-h k
produced by C-h b.

M-SPC is the keystroke for just-one-space, which deletes the spaces and tabs around the point and leaves just one space.

M-SPC is implemented using the cycle-spacing function, which cycles through 3 actions:
1. Deletes all spaces and tabs around point and leaves one space (this is what just-one-space uses)
2. Deletes all spaces
3. Restores original spaces

3. Homework: Python Scripting
randline throws an error when run on /dev/null/, because the input is empty and it tries to access data when there is none, thus creating an out of range error.

randline does not run on python3 because there is invalid syntax for python3.

When I run my shuf.py script using python2, I get a syntax error because I use f strings in my implementation, which are not supported in python2.
