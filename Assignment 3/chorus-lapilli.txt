Begining with the source code from tic-tac-toe.

+ Implemented a 3-piece max for both X and O.
I did this by adding two states to Board: xCount and oCount. Each time I clicked
an empty square, this would increment either xCount or oCount until they reached 3 pieces each.
Then I added an if statement to check for max pieces within the if statement to determine player turn.
This will allow me to branch the behavior of the game from tic tac toe to chorus lapilli.

+ Implemented ability to select a piece.
To do this I added another state to Board: selectedPiece, which is initially null.
selectedPiece is then updated to the ith square whenever X clicks on it and it's their turn (same with O).
This is the first part of moving a piece. The next step would be to allow the player to click an empty square to move there.

+ Implemented ability to move a piece.
I added an if statement within my turn if statement. It checks if there is a selected piece, and the target square is empty.
If it is, set an X/O there and remove the original X/O using the selectedPiece state. But now the problem is that pieces can
move anywhere, but they're only supposed to move adjacently.
